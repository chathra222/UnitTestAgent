# 🧠 Agentic AI-Powered Test Automation for Django Projects

This project showcases an automated CI/CD workflow where unit test cases are **generated by an Amazon Bedrock Agent** based on source code changes. When a developer pushes Django code to GitHub, an AI-powered process generates Pytest test cases, commits them in a new branch, and creates a pull request — all without manual intervention.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Code Push: A developer pushes changes to a feature branch.

- Webhook Triggered: GitHub triggers a webhook calls webhook_handler.py Lambda function through API gateway

- webhook_handler.py lambda function does following tasks:
   - Lambda Filters Files: Lambda filters modified files that need tests.
   - Invoke Bedrock Agent: Lambda passes commit info and paths to the Bedrock Agent.

- Agent does following tasks:

    - Fetches file content.
    - Generates Pytest test cases using LLM.
    - Creates a unit-tests branch based on the feature branch.
    - Commits the test files.
    - Opens a pull request.
    
- CI Pipeline: GitHub CI runs pytest on the new branch.

- Review & Merge: Developer reviews the tests and merges the PR.
